# R Code Repository

Welcome! This repository is a curated collection of modular, well-commented R scripts that I use and maintain across different applied research and evaluation projects. It’s built to support data analysis workflows common in public health, development economics, gender research, program evaluation, and systems thinking — especially in the Indian and South Asian context.

The goal is to make this repository useful for:
- Researchers and MEL professionals looking for reusable, clean R code
- Students and early-career analysts who want working examples
- Anyone interested in adapting scripts for field-focused or policy-linked work

## 🧩 What’s Included

The repository is organised by task, not by project. Each folder contains scripts with embedded example datasets and clear explanations.

### 📊 Statistical Analysis
- OLS, logistic regression, panel models
- Causal inference using DiD and propensity score matching
- Survey-weighted regressions and diagnostics

### 📈 Evaluation Methods
- Social Return on Investment (SROI)
- Cost-effectiveness calculations
- Summary tables and matrix outputs for reporting

### 🗺 Visualisation
- Clean ggplot dashboards and disaggregated plots
- Thematic maps using `sf`
- Bullet charts and waterfall diagrams for program tracking

### 💡 Integration & Automation
- Run SQL queries inside R using `sqldf`
- Export summary data for Tableau
- Use Python code inside R with `reticulate`

### 📝 Qualitative + Quantitative Tools
- Convert coded qualitative data into analysable tables
- Simulate MAXQDA-style coding outputs
- Prep data from mixed-methods fieldwork

## 📂 Sample Data Included

Most scripts include small, simulated datasets so they can run out-of-the-box. You’ll find examples built with `tibble`, `dplyr`, and `ggplot2`, and reusable logic that reflects real field conditions.

## 🤝 How to Use

1. Clone the repository or copy individual scripts
2. Each folder has a `README.md` that explains what the scripts do
3. Replace the sample data with your own inputs, if needed
4. Use comments to understand how each line fits in the workflow

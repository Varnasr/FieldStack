# R Code Repository 📊

Welcome to the R Code Repository — a structured, multi-format, and modular archive of code, notebooks, scripts, and utilities built for applied data work in development research, MEL (Monitoring, Evaluation & Learning), and public systems.

It includes reusable and annotated examples across R, Stata, Excel, SQL, and spatial workflows, with a focus on sectors like education, health, gender, climate, and livelihoods — especially in the South Asian context.

## 🧩 What You'll Find

### 🔁 Notebooks (`.qmd` + `.Rmd`)
Reusable examples using Quarto + RMarkdown:
- Weighted survey analysis
- SROI & cost-effectiveness evaluation
- Gender-disaggregated time-use
- Spatial vulnerability mapping
- File format import/export (SPSS, Stata, Excel, RDS)
- Missing data handling
- Wide-to-long reshaping
- Dashboard prep & reporting automation

### 🧠 Scripts (`.R`)
Standalone modules for:
- Survey tabulation
- Time-use analysis
- SROI ratio calculation
- Excel summary export
- Spatial mapping functions
- Data imputation and reshaping

### 🗃 Sample Data
Small, simulated datasets in:
- `.csv`, `.sav`, `.dta`, `.xlsx`, `.rds`, `.RData`

### 🌍 Spatial & GIS
- District-level `.geojson` boundary (India-mock)
- Spatial joins with access index data
- Moran’s I with `spdep`, maps with `sf`, `ggplot2`, or `tmap`

### 📊 Dashboards
- `flexdashboard` example
- `shiny` starter app
- Excel exports for Power BI
- Google Sheets-ready data for Looker Studio

### 📦 Additional Toolkits
- `utils/`: general helper functions
- `sql/`: SQL queries from R
- `stata/`: workflow integration
- `qualitative/`: coded text → tabular outputs
- `survey_tools/`, `survey-design/`: field-prep aids
- `codebook_templates/`, `custom_viz/`, `simulation/`, `evaluation/`, etc.

## 🛠 How to Use

- Browse `notebooks/` or `scripts/` by task
- Use `sample data/` to test notebooks directly
- Run `.qmd` in RStudio via **Quarto** or use `.Rmd` with **Knit**
- Clone, fork, adapt — everything is modular and replaceable

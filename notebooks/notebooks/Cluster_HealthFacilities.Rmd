# K-Means Clustering of Health Facilities

This notebook demonstrates how to use k-means clustering to segment health facilities based on patient load and staffing levels.

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(cluster)
library(factoextra)
```

## Load Data

```{r}
df <- read.csv("health_facilities.csv")
head(df)
```

## Scale and Cluster

```{r}
features <- df %>% select(patients_per_day, doctors)
scaled <- scale(features)
set.seed(123)
km <- kmeans(scaled, centers = 3, nstart = 25)
df$cluster <- as.factor(km$cluster)
```

## Plot Clusters

```{r}
fviz_cluster(km, data = scaled, geom = "point", ellipse.type = "convex")
```

## Check Cluster Centers

```{r}
aggregate(features, by=list(Cluster=df$cluster), mean)
```

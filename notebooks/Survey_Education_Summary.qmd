# Survey-Weighted Education Summary

This notebook demonstrates how to summarise educational outcomes using survey weights.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(srvyr)
library(ggplot2)

data <- read.csv("sample data/education_survey_sample.csv")

data_clean <- data %>%
  filter(!is.na(literacy), !is.na(school_completion), !is.na(weight))

survey_design <- data_clean %>%
  as_survey_design(weights = weight)

survey_summary <- survey_design %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(
    literacy_rate = survey_mean(literacy),
    school_completion_rate = survey_mean(school_completion)
  )

print(survey_summary)
```

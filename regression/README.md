# Regression Scripts

These scripts demonstrate various regression models useful in public health and development economics. Improvements include:

- Use of survey weights (`survey_weighted_model.R`)
- Handling interactions (`interaction_model.R`)
- Diagnostic tools like VIF (`multicollinearity_check.R`)
- Base cases (`logistic_model.R`, `ols_script.R`) include interpretation via odds ratios or coefficients

Each script is written for direct reuse with your datasets.
